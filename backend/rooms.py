# =============================================================================
# CollabBoard — Room Manager
# =============================================================================
# Owner : M1 (Server & DevOps)
# Sprint: Day 7 — WebSocket disconnect edge-case fixes
#
# This module implements the three room lifecycle handlers:
#   - handle_create_room: generate room, insert to PG, auto-join creator
#   - handle_join_room:   validate, insert member, send ack + snapshot,
#                         broadcast user_joined (local + Redis pub/sub)
#   - handle_leave_room:  remove member, send ack, broadcast user_left
#   - handle_disconnect_cleanup: cleanup for abrupt disconnects
#
# Each handler orchestrates 3 tiers of state per DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md:
#   Tier 1 (PostgreSQL): rooms, room_members tables
#   Tier 2 (Redis):      session:{user_id} hash, room:{id}:members set,
#                         room:{id} pub/sub channel
#   Tier 3 (Memory):     ConnectionManager.clients + room_connections
#
# Day 7 changes:
#   - Reordered state mutations in handle_create_room and handle_join_room:
#     manager.add_to_room() now runs IMMEDIATELY after PG writes, before
#     Redis writes and WebSocket sends.  This guarantees client.room_id is
#     set early, so the main.py finally block always triggers
#     handle_disconnect_cleanup — even on mid-handshake disconnects (A1).
#   - Wrapped WebSocket sends in join/create with try/except so a dead
#     connection during the handshake re-raises cleanly to main.py.
