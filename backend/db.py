Database: asyncpg pool setup, CRUD operations.

Exposes:
    pool              — Module-level asyncpg.Pool instance (None until init).
    init_db_pool()    — Create the connection pool (call from lifespan startup).
    close_db_pool()   — Close the connection pool (call from lifespan shutdown).
    upsert_user()     — Insert a new user row with a pre-assigned UUID.
    insert_room()     — Insert a new room row.
    next_seq()        — Atomically increment and return a room's seq_counter.
    insert_room_member() — Add a user to a room (with capacity check).
    remove_room_member() — Remove a user from a room.
    count_room_members() — Count current members in a room.
    get_room_members()   — List members with usernames (JOIN).
    RoomFullError        — Raised when a room is at max capacity (8).

Day 4 (M3):
    - insert_canvas_object — atomic seq + insert in one transaction

Day 5 (M3):
    - update_canvas_object  — atomic seq + JSONB merge in one transaction
    - soft_delete_canvas_object — atomic seq + soft-delete in one transaction

    Both operations execute inside a **single transaction** so the
    ``seq_counter`` is rolled back if the ``UPDATE`` fails (no sequence
    gaps).

    The ``changes`` dict may contain any combination of:
        - ``color`` (str): New ``#RRGGBB`` hex color.
        - ``stroke_width`` (int): New stroke width in pixels.

        - ``properties`` (dict): Partial JSONB merge — only provided
          keys are overwritten, existing keys are preserved via
          PostgreSQL ``||`` operator.

    Only objects where ``is_deleted = FALSE`` are eligible for update.
    If the object does not exist or has been soft-deleted, returns
    ``None`` (caller should send ``op_rejected("object_not_found")``).

    Transaction strategy (per POSTGRESQL_MIGRATION.md §6):

        obj_id: UUID v4 string of the target object.
        changes: Validated changes dict (from ``ModifyChangesPayload``).
