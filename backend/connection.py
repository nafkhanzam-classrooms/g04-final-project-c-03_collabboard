# Owner : M1 (Server & DevOps)
# Sprint: Day 6 — Disconnect cleanup hardening
#
# This module manages active WebSocket connections, tracks client session
# state, and provides broadcast utilities for room-level messaging.
#
# Day 2 scope:
#   - In-memory client registry (dict[user_id, ClientState])
#   - hello / hello_ack handshake with UUID assignment
#   - Session state machine: Connected → Identified
#   - SERVER_FULL enforcement
#   - Graceful disconnect cleanup
#
# Day 3 scope:
#   - Added room_connections reverse index (dict[room_id, set[user_id]])
#   - Helper methods: add_to_room(), remove_from_room(), get_room_connections()
#   - These enable fast local broadcast without scanning all clients
#
# Day 6 notes:
#   - disconnect() and remove_from_room() are verified idempotent — safe
#     to call even if the user was already removed (e.g. during error recovery)
#   - remove_from_room() auto-cleans the room_connections entry when the
#     last local member leaves
#
# Reference:
#   - IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md §B2
#   - WEBSOCKET_PROTOCOL_EXTENSION.md §1 (lifecycle), §10 (broadcast)
#   - DISTRIBUTED_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md §4 (Per-Backend WebSocket Handling)
#   - API_CONTRACT.md §1 (hello / hello_ack)

ConnectionManager: manages active WebSocket connections.

Provides:
    - Client registration / deregistration with UUID assignment
    - hello / hello_ack handshake orchestration
    - Session state tracking (Connected → Identified → InRoom)
    - Room-level connection index for fast local broadcast
    - Broadcast to room members (exclude-sender pattern)
